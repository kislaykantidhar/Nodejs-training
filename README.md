18. 20_Assignment.js ->Demonstrate the use of AJV, validate the JSON which should have at least these keys:-
name, age, email, subjects, cgpa.

ex: student = {
name: ‘test’,
age: 20,
email: ‘test@yopmail.com’,
subjects: [‘A1’, ‘A2’, ‘B1’, ‘B2’],
cgpa: 8
}

19. 21_Assignment.js -> Demonstrate the use of Moment. Your system should accept a date as input and validate whether the date is between your system defined date range. If it is present than return true otherwise false. Apart from this the system should tell the user, input date is near to which date of the system defined range and the difference between those date(s) in ms.

Example: Suppose your input is 2018/10/01 (YYYY/MM/DD) and system defined range is 2018/09/20 (start date range) and 2018/10/10 (end date range). Final response should be
result = {
inBetween: true,
nearDate: 2018/10/10,
difference: xxxxx(in ms)
}

20. 22_Assignment.js ->Demonstrate the use of JOI. validate the JSON which should have at least these keys:-
name, age, email, subjects, cgpa.

ex: student = {
name: ‘test’,
age: 20,
email: ‘test@yopmail.com’,
subjects: [‘A1’, ‘A2’, ‘B1’, ‘B2’],
cgpa: 8
};

21. 23_Assignment.js ->Demonstrate the use of chance, your system should always return a object where values for its keys are random.
Object should have at least these keys name, age, email, subjects, cgpa.

22. 24_Assignment.js ->Demonstrate the use of JWT (both token creation and verification)
